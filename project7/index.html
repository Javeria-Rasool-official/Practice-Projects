I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.Since completing the couse, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

                    <p>"Before joining the bootcamp.I've never written a line of code.I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.I was encouraged to enrool by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.The entire curriculum and stuff did not disappoint.They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.In fact , I've often referred to it during interviews as an exmaple of my develeopment expericence.It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after recieving multiple offers 100% recommended!
